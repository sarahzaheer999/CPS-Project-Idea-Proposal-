# Anonymity Mask

## Summary

We live in a world where everything we do is being watched by someone or the other. Surveillance cameras are propagating like insects. Facial recognition makes it harder to go about in public or online without being identified. If people are acting badly, others can readily launch an online shaming campaign against them. They can snap cellphone photos of people, post them on the Internet and then invite others to identify the people and supply information about them. But these things take away people’s freedom of expressing themselves making them feel inhibited. Anonymity Mask is a conceptual piece of art expressing the importance of anonymity in today’s world. This would comprise of a mask with projected images on it.

## Physical Parts/Components

1. A white mask. 
2. Projected Images on top of it or it displays images using foldable led stuck on it.
3. Coded Interactive file that shows what’d be displayed.

## Deconstruction

| DATA         | RENDER       | STIMULATION | EVENTS.     | 
| :---         |           :--- |        ---: |    ---: |
|Faces of different people. | Faces of different people.    | Moving Shapes. | Switch button-on|
| Shapes in different colors.  | Grid of shapes in different colors.     | Changing Faces/Shapes.    | Shapes/faces start appearing.  |
| A person’s emotional state.   |        |     |  Emotional State-button     |



## Other things to consider

1.What would the mask display? 

These are my ideas:-

- The mask could display the emotional state of a person in the form of coded images like red diamond for anger, blue circles for calmness and so on.
- The mask could also display a face made of images of people from all around the world. This could be a thousand faces or a face made of different parts of different people’s faces.

2. When would these be displayed? Is there a trigger?
  
  Yes, there is one! A switch that’ll turn on the projection/LED display


## What is going to be hard

1. Getting the data of a thousand people’s faces and joining them together.
2. A sense of interactivity.
3. How does the system know your emotional state? Does the user tell it?
